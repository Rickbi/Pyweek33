What does it mean to you to be evil?-Well, for me it is doing the opposite of my actions.-Like my twin brother, he always does the opposite of me.-If I go up, he goes down.-If I move to the right, he moves to the left.-He is my evil twin.--(Press any key to continue).
Level 1 Completed.--Twin brothers are always confused with each other.-That was the main motivation for him to become evil.-It all started with the clothes.-I wore blue and he wore red.-All of my possessions were blue and all of hers were red.
Level 2 Completed.--There were days when he tripped over walls and stones.-All this on his whim of contradicting me.-I use this to guide him to a better path.
Level 3 Completed.--Sometimes it is difficult to guide him.-But with a little imagination you can reach the goal.
Level 4 Completed.--Sometimes the path is obstructed by one or two stones.-But me and my twin are strong-At least to move just one stone.
Level 5 Completed.--You have to remember to look under the stones.-There could be something valuable under these.-But remember, if it's blue it's good.-If red is evil.
Level 6 Completed.--Sometimes his whim to follow the opposite is annoying.-It is impossible to enter through a gate with him.-But I must have imagination to get him out of the place. -Or look for a hidden path.
Level 7 Completed.--Evil twin.-Evil. Follow the opposite.-Am I the evil one through his eyes?-Am I the one who always does the opposite of him?-Now I'm afraid to see the color of my clothes.
